# -MongoDB-Database-Design-for-Patient-Monitoring
The goal of this project is to implement a solution for managing patient observation records within a specific medical sector using a NoSQL MongoDB database. This platform aims to centralize and organize information related to patients, doctors, and medical records in a structured and easily accessible format.

Through three distinct collections—patients, doctors, and medical records—the project ensures a coherent and systematic method of data storage. Clinical information and medical observations recorded by doctors are detailed and stored in the database, facilitating monitoring, analysis, and management.

Additionally, the project structure allows for efficient integration between the different entities involved. For example, information recorded in a patient’s medical record is updated in the patient’s medical history as well, ensuring consistency and continuity of medical information.
